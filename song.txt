At first I was afraid
I was petrified
I kept thinking I could never live without you
By my side
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you've done me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you
Here with that look upon your face
